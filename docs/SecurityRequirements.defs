Certificate Management System: A system used by a CA or Delegated Third Party to process, approve issuance of, or store certificates or certificate status information, including the database, database server, and storage.
Certificate Systems: The system used by a CA or Delegated Third Party in providing identity verification, registration and enrollment, certificate approval, issuance, validity status, support, and other PKI-related services.
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): A quantitative model used to measure the base level severity of a vulnerability (see http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm).
Critical Security Event: Detection of an event, a set of circumstances, or anomalous activity that could lead to a circumvention of a Zone’s security controls or a compromise of a Certificate System’s integrity, including excessive login attempts, attempts to access prohibited resources, DoS/DDoS attacks, attacker reconnaissance, excessive traffic at unusual hours, signs of unauthorized access, system intrusion, or an actual compromise of component integrity.
Critical Vulnerability: A system vulnerability that has a CVSS score of 7.0 or higher according to the NVD or an equivalent to such CVSS rating (see http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm), or as otherwise designated as a Critical Vulnerability by the CA or the CA/Browser Forum.

#CONFLICT#Delegated Third Party: A natural person or legal entity that is not the CA and that operates any part of a Certificate System.

Delegated Third Party System: Any part of a Certificate System used by a Delegated Third Party while performing the functions delegated to it by the CA.
Front End / Internal Support System: A system with a public IP address, including a web server, mail server, DNS server, jump host, or authentication server.
High Security Zone: A physical location where a CA’s or Delegated Third Party’s Private Key or cryptographic hardware is located.
Issuing System: A system used to sign certificates or validity status information.
National Vulnerability Database (NVD): A database that includes the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores of security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities associated with systems (see http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm).
OWASP Top Ten: A list of application vulnerabilities published by the Open Web Application Security Project (see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project).
Penetration Test: A process that identifies and attempts to exploit openings and vulnerabilities on systems through the active use of known attack techniques, including the combination of different types of exploits, with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses and reporting on unpatched vulnerabilities and system weaknesses.
Root CA System: A system used to create a Root Certificate or to generate, store, or sign with the Private Key associated with a Root Certificate.
SANS Top 25: A list created with input from the SANS Institute and the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) that identifies the Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors that lead to exploitable vulnerabilities (see http://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors/).
Secure Zone: An area (physical or logical) protected by physical and logical controls that appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Certificate Systems.
Security Support System: A system used to provide security support functions, such as authentication, network boundary control, audit logging, audit log reduction and analysis, vulnerability scanning, and antivirus.
System: One or more pieces of equipment or software that stores, transforms, or communicates data.
Trusted Role: An employee or contractor of a CA or Delegated Third Party who has authorized access to or control over a Secure Zone or High Security Zone.
Vulnerability Scan: A process that uses manual or automated tools to probe internal and external systems to check and report on the status of operating systems, services, and devices exposed to the network and the presence of vulnerabilities listed in the NVD, OWASP Top Ten, or SANS Top 25.
Zone: A subset of Certificate Systems created by the logical or physical partitioning of systems from other Certificate Systems.
